# Hi there 👋, my name is Hisham Ahmad

## About me
I'm a self taught software engineer. I'm a huge fan of Node.js, TypeScript, open-source, and writing testable software 💻. When I'm not crushing bugs or writing code, I can be found reading biographies, cycling, swimming, lifting weights 🏋️, and spending time with my beautiful family ❤️.
